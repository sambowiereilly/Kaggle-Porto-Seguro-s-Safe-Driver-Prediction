Understand if policy holders at one of Brazil’s largest auto insurance 
companies Porto Seguro will make an insurance claim within the next 
year can be predicted using statistical modelling techniques.

-----------------------------

Using an ensemble modelling mythology consisting of 5 different models 
(including Gradient Boosting & Generalised Additive Models as examples) a 
normalised gini coefficient score of 0.285 was achieved. 

This translates into a potential saving of approximately $600k annually 
through identification of individuals who are high risk of making a claim 
in the upcoming year.
